### What I'm Made Of: 💪

My journey's been a wild ride 🎢, much like transforming raw iron ore into a gleaming masterpiece. Born in the rainbow nation 🇿🇦, Kempton Park, South Africa, to be exact, I caught the event bug 🐞 early, thanks to my family's legacy. I'm a third-generation event pro, and let me tell you, the passion runs deep!

-   **Education:** Quenched 💧 and tempered 🔥 at the Tshwane University of Technology (BTech in Entertainment Technologies - specializing in events and theater 🎭). Also, I've got some shiny certificates 📜 from Alpha Academy and Edukators London Ltd. because, hey, who doesn't love leveling up?
-   **Experience:** 20+ years in the events industry! 🎉 From Technical Manager at SLS Productions to CEO of Maono Moja Events. I've seen it all, done it all, and I'm here to revolutionize it all! 🚀
-   **Skills:** My skills are sharper than a well-forged katana 🗡️:
    -   **Technical:**  Lighting 💡, sound 🔊, stage management 🎤, project coordination 🗂️ – you name it, I've mastered it. Plus, I'm a wizard 🧙‍♂️ at integrating AI 🤖, Microsoft Azure ☁️, and Amazon Web Services 🚀 into events.
    -   **Creative:**  I'm all about crafting those "wow" moments! ✨ My events are a blend of personalized touches and innovative tech that leave people speechless (in a good way!).
    -   **Leadership:** Leading teams is my jam! 🎶 I'm all about empowering others, sparking innovation, and making sure every event is executed flawlessly.
-   **Passions:**  I'm a tree-hugger at heart 💚! Sustainability 🌱 is my middle name (not really, but it should be). I'm on a mission to make events eco-friendly and inspire a greener future for the industry.

### My Forge: 🧰

### Current Projects: 🏗️

-   **Tech Integration:**  I'm obsessed with using the latest tech to make events more efficient and engaging. Think cloud-based platforms, AI-powered tools, and virtual events that'll blow your mind. 🤯
-   **Mentorship & Education:**  Sharing the knowledge! 🧠 I'm all about empowering the next generation of event superstars.

### Achievements - Milestones Cast in Iron: 🏆

-   **Africity 2060 Conference:**  We pulled off this epic event with 50,000+ attendees. It was HUGE!
